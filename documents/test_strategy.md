# Test Strategy for Slack Bot Application

## 1. Unit Testing

### Core Components to Test:

#### MCPManager:
- Server initialization and management
- Tool discovery and execution
- Error handling for server operations

#### ClaudeClient:
- Conversation creation and management
- Message sending and response processing
- Tool use request handling

#### SlackClient Handlers:
- Message parsing and formatting
- Thread history retrieval
- Event and action handling

### Testing Approach:
- Use pytest for unit tests
- Mock external dependencies (Anthropic API, Slack API, MCP servers)
- Test each function independently with various input scenarios
- Focus on edge cases and error handling

## 2. Integration Testing

### Integration Points to Test:
- Slack Bot ↔ Claude API: Verify message flow and response handling
- Claude Client ↔ MCP Manager: Test tool request and execution flow
- MCP Manager ↔ Tool Servers: Validate tool discovery and execution

### Testing Approach:
- Create integration test fixtures with controlled environments
- Use dependency injection to replace production services with test doubles
- Test complete workflows from user message to response
- Verify data transformations between components

## 3. End-to-End Testing

### E2E Workflows to Test:
- User mentions bot → Bot responds appropriately
- Bot requests tool use → User approves → Tool executes successfully
- Bot requests tool use → User denies → Bot handles gracefully
- Thread conversations with context preservation

### Testing Approach:
- Create a staging Slack workspace for automated tests
- Use test users and channels for controlled interactions
- Implement test scenarios that cover complete user journeys
- Automate E2E tests using a framework like Robot Framework or Cypress

## 4. Mocking Strategy

### Components to Mock:
- Slack API: Mock event triggers and responses
- Anthropic API: Create test fixtures for Claude responses
- MCP Tool Servers: Simulate tool execution without actual servers

### Mock Implementation:
- Use pytest-mock or unittest.mock
- Create fixture data for common API responses
- Implement custom mock classes for complex behaviors

## 5. Test Data Management
- Create a dedicated test config file (test_mcp.config.json)
- Generate test conversations with various scenarios
- Maintain fixture data for tool responses

## 6. Specific Test Cases

### MCPManager Tests:
- Test initialization with valid/invalid config
- Verify server start/stop/restart functionality
- Test tool discovery and execution
- Validate error handling for server failures

### ClaudeClient Tests:
- Test conversation creation with/without tools
- Verify message sending and response parsing
- Test handling of different response types (text, tool request, final answer)
- Validate tool result handling

### SlackClient Handler Tests:
- Test mention handling in channels and threads
- Verify thread history retrieval and formatting
- Test tool approval/denial workflows
- Validate message posting logic
- Test thread timestamp extraction for different Slack event structures
- Test fallback mechanisms for thread timestamp retrieval
- Test handling of interactive components with various payload structures
- Verify correct thread context is maintained across interactions

### Error Handling Tests:
- Test behavior when Claude API is unavailable
- Verify handling of MCP server failures
- Test recovery from tool execution errors
- Test graceful handling of missing thread timestamps
- Test recovery from malformed Slack event payloads

## 7. Performance and Load Testing
- Measure response times under various loads
- Test concurrent user interactions
- Verify memory usage over extended operation
- Test with large conversation histories

## 8. Security Testing
- Verify proper handling of API keys and tokens
- Test input validation and sanitization
- Verify access controls for tool execution
- Test for potential information leakage

## 9. Test Environment Setup

### Development Environment:
- Local Slack development workspace
- Local MCP servers with test tools
- Mocked Claude API

### Staging Environment:
- Dedicated Slack workspace
- Test instances of MCP servers
- Controlled Claude API access

## 10. CI/CD Integration
- Run unit and integration tests on each commit
- Schedule regular E2E tests in staging environment
- Implement test coverage reporting
- Set quality gates based on test results

## 11. Testing Tools and Frameworks
- Primary: pytest for unit and integration tests
- Mocking: pytest-mock for dependency simulation
- Coverage: pytest-cov for test coverage reporting
- E2E: Robot Framework or similar for automated UI testing
- CI Integration: GitHub Actions or Jenkins

## 12. Test Maintenance Strategy
- Keep test files organized by component
- Implement shared fixtures for common test scenarios
- Document test assumptions and requirements
- Review and update tests as features evolve
- Create regression tests for fixed bugs, especially for Slack payload handling
